Final Project
3/11/2016

Files in this project: Item.rb
                       Inventory.rb
 		       Fight.rb
		       TrainCar.rb
		       Interaction.rb
		       Person.rb
		       Train.rb

To run, just type "ruby Train.rb" in the command line in the folder with all these files.
Ruby interprets strings better than python does, so you can just input strings - option rather than "option".
